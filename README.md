## Day 1

> 1.Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included).The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

```python
list=[]
for i in range(2000,3001):
    if i%7==0 and i%5 !=0:
        list.append(i)
print(list)
```
> 2.Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8 Then, the output should be:40320

```python
num=int(input("请输入数字："))
i=0
j=1
while i<num:
    j=(i+1)*j
    i=i+1
print(j)
```

> With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i x i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary.Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8
Then, the output should be:
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}

```python
num=int(input("请输入您的数字："))
dic=dict()
if num<=0:
    print("输入不规范！")
for i in range(1,num+1):
    if i>0:
        dic[i]=i*i
print(dic)
```
